# Space Invaders Copy

## Overview
Space Invaders Copy is a Python-based recreation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. This project is focused on the survival of a spaceship defending Earth, controlled by the user. The spaceship must fend off attacks from aliens and protect the planet.

## Features
- **Alien Attacks**: Aliens spawn at random locations and move towards the spaceship at varying speeds.
- **Spaceship Control**: Use left and right arrow keys to control the movement of the spaceship.
- **Missile Firing**: The space bar is used to shoot missiles at the aliens.
- **Health Bar**: Indicates the remaining health of the spaceship. The game ends when the health bar is depleted.
- **Score Keeping**: The game keeps track of the survival time as the player's score.

## Game Mechanics
- **Enemy Creation**: Enemies are created and move down the screen towards the player.
- **Missile Mechanics**: Missiles are fired by the player to destroy incoming enemies.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between missiles, the spaceship, and enemies.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends when the spaceship's health bar runs out or if too many aliens get past the spaceship.

## How to Run
- Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (pygame, gamebox).
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Run `game.py` to start the game:
