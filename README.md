# Space Invaders Copy

## Overview
Space Invaders Copy is a Python-based recreation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. This project emphasizes the survival of a spaceship, controlled by the user, as it defends Earth against alien invasions.

## Features
- **Alien Attacks**: Randomly spawning aliens move toward the spaceship at varying speeds.
- **Spaceship Control**: Navigate the spaceship using the left and right arrow keys.
- **Missile Firing**: Use the space bar to shoot missiles at aliens.
- **Health Bar**: Tracks the spaceship's health, with the game ending when health is depleted.
- **Score Tracking**: Measures survival time, which serves as the player's score.

## Game Mechanics
- **Enemy Creation**: Enemies are generated and descend toward the spaceship.
- **Missile Mechanics**: Players fire missiles to eliminate approaching enemies.
- **Collision Detection**: Interactions between missiles, the spaceship, and enemies are accurately detected.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends when the spaceship's health bar depletes or if too many aliens breach Earth's defenses.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (`pygame`, `gamebox`) installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkanMNdem/space-invaders-copy.git
   cd space-invaders-copy
   ```

3. Run the game using:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for game logic and mechanics.
- **Pygame & Gamebox**: Libraries used for graphics, input handling, and game physics.

## Note
This project is a clone of Space Invaders created for educational purposes. It demonstrates programming skills in game development and graphical interfaces.

## Contributing
This project is not open for external contributions as it is intended solely for educational demonstration.
